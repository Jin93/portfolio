	abstract = {Mendelian Randomization (MR) analysis is increasingly popular for testing the causal effect of exposures on disease outcomes using data from genome-wide association studies. In some settings, the underlying exposure, such as systematic inflammation, may not be directly observable, but measurements can be available on multiple biomarkers, or other types of traits, that are co-regulated by the exposure. We propose method MRLE, which tests the significance for, and the direction of, the effect of a latent exposure by leveraging information from multiple related traits. The method is developed by constructing a set of estimating functions based on the second-order moments of summary association statistics, under a structural equation model where genetic variants are assumed to have indirect effects through the latent exposure and potentially direct effects on the traits. Simulation studies showed that MRLE has well-controlled type I error rates and increased power compared to single-trait MR tests under various types of pleiotropy. Applications of MRLE using genetic association statistics across five inflammatory biomarkers (CRP, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-Î± and MCP-1) provided evidence for potential causal effects of inflammation on increased risk of coronary artery disease, colorectal cancer and rheumatoid arthritis, while standard MR analysis for individual biomarkers often failed to detect consistent evidence for such effects.},

	shorttitle = {Associations between Cannabis and Alcohol Consumption Polygenic Risk Scores and Ever Misusing Opioids in an Urban, African American Cohort},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: This study leveraged results from large-scale GWAS to examine whether polygenic risk scores (PRS) for lifetime cannabis use and alcohol consumption were associated with ever misusing opioids and whether sex differences existed in these relations in an urban, African American sample.
METHODS: Data were drawn from three cohorts of participants (N = 1,103; 45% male) who were recruited in first grade as part of a series of elementary school-based, universal preventive interventions conducted in a Mid-Atlantic region of the U.S. In young adulthood, participants provided a DNA sample and reported on whether they had used heroin or misused prescription narcotic drugs in their lifetime. Lifetime cannabis use PRS were created based on GWAS conducted by Pasman et al. (2018). PRS for alcohol consumption were created based on two GWAS, one conducted by Gelertner et al. (2019) focused on maximum drinking (i.e., largest number of drinks in one day in a typical month), and another conducted by Kranzler et al. (2019) focused on alcohol consumption indexed via the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT-C). 
RESULTS: Higher PRS for lifetime cannabis use and greater maximum drinking and alcohol consumption were associated with a greater likelihood of misusing opioids among the whole sample and males.
CONCLUSION: Findings suggest that cannabis and alcohol consumption are pleiotropic with opioid misuse among young adults generally and males specifically, elucidating the genetic architecture of this public health problem, though replication of our findings are needed.
