I am an Assistant Professor of Biostatistics at the the University of Pennsylvania, Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Informatics. I worked as a postdoctoral fellow in Dr. [Nilanjan Chatterjee](https://nilanjanchatterjee.org/)'s group at the [Department of Biostatistics](https://www.jhsph.edu/departments/biostatistics/), Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in 2019 - 2022. I received my Ph.D. in Biostatistics from the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities in 2019 under the supervision of Drs. [Joeseph S. Koopmeiners](https://directory.sph.umn.edu/bio/sph-a-z/joseph-koopmeiners) and [Lin Zhang](https://directory.sph.umn.edu/bio/sph-a-z/lin-zhang). Before that I received my Bachelor's degree in statistics from the [School for the Gifted Young](https://en.scgy.ustc.edu.cn/), University of Science and Technology of China ([USTC](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/)).

My research interests focus on developing statistical and computational methods to address cutting-edge problems in public health and medicine by integrating large-scale, multi-source datasets. Within this scope, my research involves health equity in disease risk prediction, statistical genetics, Bayesian hierarchical models for high-dimensional, complex-structured data, and statistical data integration.

In February 2022, I received an [NIH Pathway to Independence Award (K99/R00) award](https://reporter.nih.gov/search/5u7x8jpqxUSznDKcHnIqSw/project-details/10349828) from the National Human Genome Research Institute ([NHGRI](https://www.genome.gov/)) as a Principal Investigator for multi-ethnic disease risk prediction integrating multi-source information on genetic and other risk factors.
